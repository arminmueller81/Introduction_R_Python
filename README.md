# Python_introduction
This repository includes the code for some sessions of my Python course organised in Jupyter Notebooks. The sessions use common packages like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn; as well as data sets from different packages. Cloning the repository and executing the code in a Python environment should be straightforward.
