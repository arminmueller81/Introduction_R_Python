# Python_introduction
This repository includes the code for some sessions of my Python course organised in Jupyter Notebooks. The sessions use common packages like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn; as well as data sets from different packages. Cloning the repository and executing the code in a Python 3 environment should be straightforward.

## Data sources:
The NYC Flights dataset is sourced from the nycflights13 package (see: https://pypi.org/project/nycflights13/; under Creative Commons license CC0, see: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/index.html).
Hitters dataset: sourced from the `ISLP` package for Python, intended for educational use (see: https://pypi.org/project/ISLP/; BSD License)
