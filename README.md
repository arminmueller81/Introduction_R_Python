# Introduction to R and Python
This repository includes the code for some sessions of my Introduction to R (Tidyverse) and Python.

R code is provided as regular R-file or markdown (.rmd) file.
Python code is organised in Jupyter Notebooks. The sessions use common packages like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn; as well as data sets from different packages. Cloning the repository and executing the code in a Python 3 environment should be straightforward.

## Data sources:
The NYC Flights dataset is sourced from the nycflights13 package (see: https://pypi.org/project/nycflights13/; under Creative Commons license CC0, see: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/index.html).
